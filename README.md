# ITSM-Tickets
1. I am using Random Forest Algorithm to predict high priority tickets  .
2. Random forest algorithm can use both for classification and the regression kind of problems. In this, other tasks are performed through performing multitude of Decision Trees in a Training time and getting output of classes i.e. mean and mode of other classes.
3. Random forest classifier will handle the missing values.
4. When we have more trees in the forest, random forest classifier wonâ€™t overfit  the model.
5. Can model the random forest classifier for categorical values also.
Ex: - It can be used for quality Assessment.
